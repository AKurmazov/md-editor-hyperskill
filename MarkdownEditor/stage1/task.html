<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Welcome to the first stage of the project!&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you ever worked with markdown, you will probably recognize the syntax here:</p>

<pre>
	<code class="language-markdown"># The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*</code>
</pre>

<p>Yes! It is a raw markdown&nbsp;code, and it is to be translated to something looking like&nbsp;this:</p>

<h3>The Beatles</h3>

<p>One may say that they were the most famous <strong>rock band</strong> ever.<br />
The legendary <strong>line-up</strong> comprised the following people:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>John Lennon</em></li>
	<li><em>Paul McCartney</em></li>
	<li><em>George Harrison</em></li>
	<li><em>Ringo Starr</em></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, I propose you to do exactly the opposite you&#39;ve been shown In the description part: you will be given a fancy-looking&nbsp;markdown snippet, and you will have to determine its&nbsp;source code. By all means, you will need to get acquainted with the basics of the&nbsp;syntax. I suggest using <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this tutorial</a>&nbsp;&mdash; it is easy to follow and covers all the necessary topics.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the snippet of markdown to analyze:</p>

<h3>John Lennon</h3>

<p>or&nbsp;<em><strong>John Winston Ono Lennon,</strong></em>&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;<em>The Beatles</em>.<br />
Here are the songs he wrote I like the most:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Imagine</li>
	<li>Norwegian Wood</li>
	<li>Come Together</li>
	<li>In My Life</li>
	<li><strike>Hey Jude</strike>&nbsp;(that was&nbsp;<em>McCartney</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that we gave you this snippet to translate:</p>

<h3>The List of&nbsp;Albums</h3>

<p>During their history, a lot of great albums were released.<br />
These are my favorite:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Abbey Road</li>
	<li>Rubber Soul</li>
	<li>Revolver</li>
	<li>A Hard Day&#39;s Night</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, we would expect you to print to the console&nbsp; the following code:</p>

<pre>
	<code class="language-markdown"># The List of Albums
During their history, a lot of great albums were released.
These are my favorite:
1. Abbey Road
2. Rubber Soul
3. Revolver
4. A Hard Day's Night</code>
